# About me

My name is Oliwia Szczypek. I'm a recent graduate of a Manual and Automation Tester at CodersLab School.
I have chosen this field of study because I want to develop my skills and knowledge within the IT industry. 
As this is a very feature-oriented profession, I'm currently looking for opportunities that will help me grow. 
Now, I'm focusing on finding a new job and learning my English skills.
